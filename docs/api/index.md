Contains documentation of the `ormar` internal API.

Note that this is a technical part of the documentation intended for `ormar` contributors.

!!!note
    For completeness as of now even the internal and special methods are documented and exposed in API docs.

!!!warning
    The current API docs version is a beta and not all methods are documented, 
    also some of redundant items are included since it was partially auto generated.

!!!danger
    Ormar is still under development, and the **internals can change at any moment**.

    You shouldn't rely even on the "public" methods if they are not documented in the 
    normal part of the docs.
